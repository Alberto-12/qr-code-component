## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to work with images in HTML and also styling with CSS.

```html
<img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="" width="288" height="288">
```

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to learn more about HTML and CSS and Javascript to add interactivity to the project.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp) - This helped me for the HTML image tag.
